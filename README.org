* DESCRIPTION

  This project aims to be integrated with [[http://www.quattor.org][Quattor]]. It allows to
  associate arbitrary code with any annotation in the header of the
  Pan templates.

  The main usage is to generate a Pan template out of an external
  source, f.i, contents of an LDAP server.
